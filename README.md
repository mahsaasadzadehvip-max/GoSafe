# GoSafe
This is the Team Palms Foundation Program App! 
GoSafe is an app built with SwiftUI and MapKit that visualizes crime data in real-time. Designed to enhance urban safety awareness, the app aggregates data from official sources (MineCrime API) to provide users with a clear, interactive map of risk zones in Naples (and potentially other cities).


Features
 • Interactive Risk Mapping: Uses MapKit (UIKit wrapper) to display crime events as custom annotations on a detailed map.
 • Smart Clustering: Implements MKClusterAnnotation to group nearby events into clusters, ensuring high performance and readability even with thousands of data points.
 • Advanced Search: Integrated MKLocalSearch and MKLocalSearchCompleter to allow users to search for specific addresses or points of interest within the city.
 • Modern UI: A sleek interface featuring a gradient navigation bar, custom search bar, and floating action buttons.
